# Grapevine-Leaves-Classification

This project aims to classify grapevine leaves based on their species using deep learning techniques.
 Grapevine leaves have economic significance due to their use in various products, and it's important to differentiate between different species for pricing and taste reasons.
 In this study, I used images of grapevine leaves from five different species to train deep-learning models for classification.

The main objective of this project is to build a classification model that can accurately classify grapevine leaves into their respective species
 based on images. This involves using pre-trained deep learning models and fine-tuning them for this specific task.

In this project, I successfully developed a deep-learning model for classifying grapevine leaves into different species.
 I compared the performance of the model trained with and without denoising autoencoder and found that training on original
 images yielded better results. The model achieved high accuracy, making it suitable for practical applications such as species identification
 in the grapevine industry. Additionally, K-fold cross-validation demonstrated the model's consistency and reliability.

 I used Libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, MatPlotLib, TensorFlow, and Keras.
